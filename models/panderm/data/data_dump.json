            "Melanoma treatment depends on the stage and location of the disease, as well as the patient's overall health. Options include surgery, which is the primary treatment for early-stage melanomas. In some cases, lymph nodes may also be removed. Other treatments include immunotherapy, which boosts the body's natural defenses to fight the cancer; targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells; chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells; and radiation therapy, which uses high-powered energy beams, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells. In some cases, a combination of these treatments may be used."

The exact cause isn't clear, but exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds increases your risk of developing melanoma. Other factors that can increase your risk include having many moles or abnormal moles, a family history of melanoma, fair skin, a history of sunburn, living closer to the equator or at a higher elevation, and having a weak immune system."

Common symptoms follow the ABCDE rule: Asymmetry (one half of the mole doesn't match the other), Border irregularity (the edges are ragged or notched), Color variations (having a variety of colors is a warning sign), Diameter (melanomas are usually larger in diameter than the eraser on your pencil, but they may be smaller when first detected), and Evolving (any change in size, shape, color, elevation, or another trait, or any new symptom such as bleeding, itching or crusting, may signal melanoma)."

These mutations can cause the cells to multiply rapidly and form malignant tumors. The primary environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, including sunlight and tanning beds, which can cause DNA damage in cells. Genetic factors, such as having a family history of melanoma and having certain gene mutations, can also increase risk."

BCC is caused mainly due to long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning beds.\n\nSymptoms typically include a noticeable change in the skin, like a growth or sore that doesn't heal, often appears on the face or neck, pearl-like bumps, or dark patches.\n\nTreatment options depend on the size, location, and type of BCC, as well as the patient's overall health. This could range from a simple excision (surgery), Mohs surgery (a layer-by-layer removal), and curettage and desiccation (scraping and using electricity), to radiation therapy, topical treatments, or systemic medications in advanced cases"

            "What is basal cell carcinoma, its causes, and how can it be treated?",
            "Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer. It originates in the basal cells, which line the deepest layer of the epidermis (the outermost layer of the skin). \n\nBasal cell carcinoma is primarily caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or indoor tanning. Other risk factors include a personal or family history of skin cancer, older age, fair skin, and immune-suppressing drugs.\n\nThe type of treatment depends on the size, depth, and location of the basal cell carcinoma, as well as the patient's overall health. Surgical methods of treatment include excision, Mohs surgery, curettage and electrodessication. Other treatments can include radiation therapy, topical medications, or a type of light therapy known as photodynamic therapy. Early detection and treatment can help prevent the carcinoma from spreading"

            "What is basal cell carcinoma, its causes, symptoms, and possible treatment options?",
            "Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer. It arises from the basal cells, which are found at the bottom of the top layer of the skin. BCC often develops as a result of long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, either from the sun or tanning beds.\n\nBCC tends to appear as a small, translucent or pearly bump on the skin, often on sun-exposed areas like the face and neck. It may bleed or develop a crust, and it usually doesn't heal completely.\n\nTreatment options depend on the type, size, location, and depth of the BCC, as well as the patient's age and health. Options can include surgical excision, where the tumor and some healthy skin around it is removed, Mohs surgery, where the tumor is removed in layers, and radiation therapy. In some"
